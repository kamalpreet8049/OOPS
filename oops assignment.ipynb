A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.\n","\n","3.What is an object in OOP?\n","\n","Ans.A fundamental building block representing a specific instance of a class.\n","\n","4.What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n","\n","Ans.Abstraction focuses on hiding unnecessary complexity and showing only the essential features of an object, while encapsulation focuses on bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit (class) and restricting access to the internal details.\n","\n","5.What are dunder methods in Python?\n","\n","Ans.Dunder methods, also known as magic methods or special methods, are a set of predefined methods in Python that have double underscores at both the beginning and end of their names (e.g., __init__, __str__, __len__).\n","\n","6.Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n","\n","Ans.A mechanism where a new class (child or derived class) can inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class (parent or base class).\n","\n","7.What is polymorphism in OOP?\n","\n","Ans.the ability of an object to take on many forms.\n","\n","8.How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n","\n","Ans.Encapsulation in Python is achieved through a combination of conventions and language features, though it differs from the strict access modifiers found in languages like Java.\n","\n","9.What is a constructor in Python?\n","\n","Ans.In Python, a constructor is a special method used to initialize the attributes of an object when an instance of a class is created.\n","\n","10.What are class and static methods in Python?\n","\n","Ans.A class method is a method bound to the class itself, not to an instance of the class.\n","A static method is a method that belongs to the class but does not take self (instance) or cls (class) as its first argument\n","\n","11.What is method overloading in Python?\n","\n","Ans.Method overloading, in the context of Python, refers to the ability to define multiple methods within a single class that share the same name but differ in their parameters.\n","\n","12.What is method overriding in OOP?\n","\n","Ans. when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n","\n","13.What is a property decorator in Python?\n","\n","Ans.the @property decorator in Python is a built-in decorator that transforms a method within a class into a \"property,\" allowing it to be accessed and modified like a regular attribute, while still enabling the execution of custom logic (such as validation, computation, or logging) during attribute access, modification, or deletion.\n","\n","14.Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n","\n","Ans.because it allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type, promoting code reusability, flexibility, and maintainability.\n","\n","15.What is an abstract class in Python?\n","\n","Ans.An abstract class in Python is a class that serves as a blueprint or template for other classes. It cannot be instantiated directly, meaning you cannot create objects of an abstract class.\n","\n","16.What are the advantages of OOP?\n","\n","Ans.Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) offers several advantages, primarily enhancing code organization, reusability, and maintainability.\n","\n","17.What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n","\n","Ans. Class variables are shared among all instances of a class, while instance variables are unique to each object (instance) of a class.\n","\n","18.What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n","\n","Ans.Multiple inheritance in Python is a feature of object-oriented programming where a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. This allows a single child class to combine functionalities from multiple distinct sources.\n","\n","19.Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n","\n","Ans.n Python, __str__ and __repr__ are special methods (often called \"dunder methods\" due to their double underscores) that define how an object is represented as a string.\n","\n","20.What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n","\n","Ans.The super() function in Python holds significant importance in the context of object-oriented programming, particularly when dealing with inheritance.\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"AQDeh9f8JUmV"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#1.
